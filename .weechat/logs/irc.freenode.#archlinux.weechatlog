I have been trying to configure X so that I run my two monitors off of separate amd graphics cards with Xinerama: https://gist.github.com/Alittlemurkling/9408189. To no avail. On top of this, it has become impossible to switch from X to a tty at any point. ctrl+alt+F1-7 do absolutely nothing in both lightdm and gnome. X's logs don't give me any errors.

In Ubuntu when I do sudo apt-get install p and hit tab, it immediately says: "Show all 4000 posibilities?". How do I speed up pacman autocompletion? For example when I type pacman -S urxvt- and hit tab, it also lags for half a second. I've done pacman-optimize

I know vdpau works because VDPAU_DRIVER=va_gl vdpauinfo drops no errors. So with the latest version of the mentioned packages I get a black flash player instead of the video (I can see the controls and yt players says that video decoding acceleration
