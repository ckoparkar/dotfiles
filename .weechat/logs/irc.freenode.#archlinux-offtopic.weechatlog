2014-03-07 19:58:59	Arch-TK	Why the hell do you even go on twitter anyway?
2014-03-07 19:59:01	Achillion	8 characters
2014-03-07 19:59:08	Arch-TK	This is an x y problem and the solution is to stop going on twitter.
2014-03-07 19:59:11	Achillion	Arch-TK: to follow @archlinux, duh
2014-03-07 19:59:15	zipper	I meant all utf8 chars

2014-03-07 20:05:02	Arch-TK	only about 10% have supposedly been used
2014-03-07 20:05:10	Arch-TK	you can't "see all unicode chars" because some of them don't exist.
2014-03-07 20:05:25	zipper	Arch-TK: I understand now.
2014-03-07 20:05:43	zipper	demize: Why won't you tell me what you have against twitter?
2014-03-07 20:05:46	Arch-TK	And some of them, like the pile of shit symbol, barely have supporting charsets.
2014-03-07 20:06:02	Arch-TK	What you don't need is "all the unicode chars" what you need is "common unicode chars2
2014-03-07 20:06:03	@demize	zipper: No one has said anything against twitter.
2014-03-07 20:06:25	Arch-TK	demize definitely didn't. I might have said something or two against twitter.
