2014-03-05 22:44:42	nyuszika7h	luto: it could be possible, but there's two issues with it at least:
2014-03-05 22:45:27	nyuszika7h	- all the old issues will be opened by a single user, comments also sent by that user
2014-03-05 22:45:30	nyuszika7h	- each issue needs to be tagged 'enhancement' or 'bug' for clear separation like before
2014-03-05 22:45:46	nyuszika7h	- what about fixed issues? don't migrate them? open and immediately close them?

2014-03-06 20:18:50	Lurker3	If I have a split window (with /window splith/v), if I'm highlighted in the non-current split window the buffer-list from buffers.pl doesn't turn purple like it normally does.
2014-03-06 20:18:56	Lurker3	Is this a bug, or is there a setting I'm missing?
2014-03-06 20:20:06	Nei	good question
2014-03-06 20:21:41	Lurker3	It also doesn't seem to turn other colours to show activity at all if it's 'open' in the split-window view, but not actively highlighted either

2014-03-07 15:50:28	@FlashCode	/layout does not connect to anything
2014-03-07 15:50:42	BRO	what do you mean?
2014-03-07 15:50:45	@FlashCode	it will just replit windows, and move buffers to appropriate number, but when the buffers are opened
2014-03-07 15:50:58	@FlashCode	so you have to configure autojoin for irc servers for example
2014-03-07 15:51:03	@FlashCode	and autoconnect to servers
2014-03-07 15:51:07	BRO	but I did
2014-03-07 15:51:14	BRO	and it IS trying to reconnect
2014-03-07 15:51:23	BRO	except it says connection failure
2014-03-07 15:51:30	BRO	I swear it has to do with /layout store
2014-03-07 15:51:30	@FlashCode	then it's not a layout problem
2014-03-07 15:51:33	@FlashCode	no
2014-03-07 15:51:34	BRO	it doesn't do that otherwise
2014-03-07 15:51:36	BRO	yes it is
2014-03-07 15:51:38	BRO	yes it is
2014-03-07 15:51:51	@FlashCode	the layout has nothing to do with network connection to a server
2014-03-07 15:51:53	BRO	if I /quit now and reopen weechat
2014-03-07 15:51:57	BRO	it will work perfectly
2014-03-07 15:52:03	BRO	not if I /layout store before

2014-03-07 15:58:16	@FlashCode	it should be some network problem on your side, or on server side
2014-03-07 15:58:19	BRO	FlashCode: anyway, can you explain this? http://i.imgur.com/fp0N5c7.png
2014-03-07 15:58:38	BRO	it's an integer
2014-03-07 15:58:42	BRO	I believe it should be a string
2014-03-07 15:59:00	@FlashCode	in fact it's an interger internally, but with string values
2014-03-07 15:59:18	@FlashCode	so that you have to give a string with /set (easier), stored as integer internally
2014-03-07 15:59:40	BRO	hmmmmmm
2014-03-07 15:59:44	@FlashCode	that means you can only give values mentioned in /help, no other string
2014-03-07 16:00:05	@FlashCode	a "string" option can accept any string, that's the diff
2014-03-07 16:00:20	BRO	I see
2014-03-07 16:00:27	BRO	it's like an enum
2014-03-07 16:00:37	@FlashCode	yes
2014-03-07 16:00:52	BRO	about the connection problem:
2014-03-07 16:01:46	BRO	if I let weechat opened, it will try to connect, fail, retry, fail, retry, etc., until I /quit and relaunch it again
2014-03-07 16:01:50	BRO	so… I don't think it has anything to do with my connection

2014-03-07 16:27:10	BRO	so I'm pretty sure it would work

2014-03-07 20:34:20	Nei	hehe
2014-03-07 20:34:33	Nei	I see what you mean
2014-03-07 20:34:59	Nei	that's because by default you can imagine a "paste" the same as if you typed it in

2014-03-07 20:35:13	Nei	ie, end of the first line
2014-03-07 20:35:15	Nei	then it will get send
2014-03-07 20:35:27	Nei	and the next line starts fresh, on an empty input
2014-03-07 20:35:52	Nei	you could try my multiline script
2014-03-07 20:35:57	Mikaela	Should I use markdown syntax quotes then?
2014-03-07 20:36:03	Mikaela	I'll check

2014-03-07 20:36:44	Nei	any "newline/enter" will send the current state of the input

2014-03-07 20:36:59	Nei	so what you could do instead is copy the quote including the quote marks

2014-03-07 20:37:38	Nei	the quote won't move over to the second line, it will get sent as part of the first line
2014-03-07 20:39:16	Mikaela	This is multiline?

2014-03-07 20:39:39	Mikaela	Maybe I will read the full help
2014-03-07 20:39:43	Nei	it would work with multiline
2014-03-07 20:39:49	Nei	or, should, anyway
2014-03-07 20:40:06	Nei	because multiline redefines the enter to make multiple lines, so quotes would carry over too

2014-03-07 20:41:10	Mikaela	I'm not sure if I understand how to use this. It seems to want to use multiple lines when I don't need them and the opposite.
2014-03-07 20:41:44	Nei	by default it will always go for multiline but send them out after a short delay if you decide you dont want multiline

2014-03-07 20:42:13	Nei	Ie just use it as normal but you'll have to wait a tiny fraction after enter for it to get sent
2014-03-07 20:42:48	Nei	you can use it in two other ways, disable the multiline and only use it for pastes, or define yourself another key for sending messages immediately (like alt+s = send)
2014-03-07 20:43:08	Mikaela	I think that the thing which I want is magic paste.

2014-03-07 22:24:46	Mikaela	FlashCode: Notifico has button "sync with GitHub", click it and add #weechat to announcement channels and Notifico bot joins on next commit and announces it.

2014-03-07 22:28:50	whiskers75	it works with github if you can port forward ;P

2014-03-07 22:29:39	grawity	how about an internal service?
2014-03-07 22:29:48	grawity	run Irker on your own server, point GitHub's Irker hook at it
2014-03-07 22:30:18	grawity	KGB is another similar bot

2014-03-07 22:31:10	whiskers75	Mikaela: just adopt a fluxbot
2014-03-07 22:31:21	whiskers75	they can keep ops for you too
2014-03-07 22:31:45	Mikaela	Limnoria (supybot fork) also has GitHub plugin. It requires hook to be set at GitHub too.
2014-03-07 22:31:59	whiskers75	Mikaela: fluxbot is like limnoria, but in node.js
2014-03-07 22:32:01	Mikaela	I have no need for another bot. Limnoria is currently doing everything that I need them to do.
2014-03-07 22:32:09	Mikaela	I have nothing against Python.

2014-03-14 13:03:40	tomoe-mami	in script, is it possible to grab an existing bar item and change its content?
2014-03-14 13:03:56	@FlashCode	no
2014-03-14 13:04:25	@FlashCode	the bar content is "volatile", it is set with a callback and stored by weechat in internal structures
2014-03-14 13:08:04	gb	hmm sounds dangerous a volatile bar
2014-03-14 13:13:45	@FlashCode	gb: why?
2014-03-14 13:14:16	@FlashCode	content of bars is somewhat dynamic, and composed by items that you can add/remove/reorder, and these items are updated by callbacks, on events
2014-03-14 13:14:57	@FlashCode	tomoe-mami: why do you need to do that? maybe there are other ways to do it
2014-03-14 13:17:02	tomoe-mami	forget my question, FlashCode. i was just playing around with text_item.py and thought what if i edit it so it can also change other bar item. well it's a stupid thought
