2014-03-07 13:41:00	lars_	Ok, ikonia, thanks for trying to help me, at this point, I think it is safe to assume that the trash icon cannot be changed on Kubuntu 12.04, so I will just keep using the strange page icon I have now.  At least I tried.  Spending an hour tryig to fix a trash icon is a waste of time.  This is why I like Windows more.

It also happens when I use my phone as a portable wifi hotspot, after I have turned off the wifi hotspot. It's an irritation rather

2014-03-07 15:34:51	cfhowlett	EleanorEllis, no worries.  as far as learning curve, it's incremental.  the more problems you solve, the more you'll learn.  stay in this channel and observe.  sooner or later, someone will ask a question YOU can solve.

I'd first like to fix the crashes, seemingly caused by Xorg since I got a message saying xorg failed to idle channel something. This is on a Macbook Pro 7.1

I ask because that's precisely what I was doing -- typing so quickly that I didn't have time to react to the window that popped up.

The expected behavior is that this job will run at a set interval, look for certain data and write that to a file (and overwrite each time it runs).  However, when the job runs it deletes any information in the file it should be writing to, leaving it blank.  Can anyone help out?

I want these IPs blocked forever.  The nature of fail2ban (I already set a negative number for the ban time) is that it bans something temporarily.  again, I want the bans to be permanent.
2014-03-07 22:40:03	siberiannerd	sudormrf, it is a good idea to not ban things on a persistent basis due to the fact iptables doesn't "like" it - to store hundreds of such records, pick some consensus period

I still have my / and swap partitions on the same drive.  I also have many backups of important files, but a recovery would be preferable.

2014-03-14 12:40:38	dougbb	I have a 13.10 laptop with an nvidia card. It's worked well for years, but this week I had a weird problem where terminal windows were dropping characters. So I tried switching from the nvidia drivers to the nouveau drivers, but after logging in the window was badly scrambled and unusable. I then booted in recovery mode and switched back to the nvidia drivers, but the settings are still not right ... for example compositing doesn't work at all. Is there a way

I'm a volunteer working for a talking newspaper group. We made a digital studio 2 yrs ago running with XP but it has limitations. Linux offers more. Thanks again for your help. Pete

I would also strongly recommend to use stow to manage such installation to /usr/local in the future as that makes removals mich easier. Either way, you have to get rid of those libraries or LD_PRELOAD the correct ones.

2014-03-14 16:30:46	jonascj	Hi all. I am trying to detect/see/monitor which wifi channel my computer's wifi is using. E.g. my house have two APs with different channel, I would like visual evidence on my screen that network manager (or the hardware) changes channel when I roam about the house.
